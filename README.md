This Wordle consists of the original wordle word list (2315 words) and a custom word list (4980 words).
Users can access the interactive offline Wordle supported by Tkinter by running main.py.
There are two algorithmic solver, while information_solver is the more superior one.
The solver is inspired by 3blue1brown, with the exclusion of incorporating word frequencies due to its gimmicky.
